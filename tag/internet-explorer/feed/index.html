				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In all but the most basic of web site designs developers will invariably encounter situations where Internet Explorer requires a good kick in the CSS before it’ll render the page in the desired way.  Often, a quick fix is applied in the shape of an IE specific external stylesheet, hidden from other browsers with conditional comments:</p>
<p><code>&lt;!--[if IE]&gt;&lt;link href="ie.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;</code></p>
<p>This does the job, but there are a number of down sides to this approach, which in my opinion, make it the wrong choice in many circumstances for both user experience and code maintainability.</p>
<p>The main reasons for using conditional stylesheets are to avoid CSS hacks and create a smaller code footprint for standards compliant browsers.  But are these really problems that need fixing?</p>
<h3>Validation</h3>
<p>HTML validation is good practice, mainly due to a loss in semantic meaning as well as the lack of consistency with regard to error handling in the standards and implementations.  However, CSS is purely presentational and does not convey any semantic meaning.  Furthermore, the original CSS standard defines strict parsing rules which dictate exactly how to deal with invalid rules.  Well tested and widely used hacks such as the * and _ hacks are extremely unlikely to cause problems in standards compliant browsers.</p>
<p>Invalid CSS hidden from modern browsers and the validator is still just that &#8211; invalid CSS.  Hiding invalid code within conditional comments does not make it valid, it merely prevents subsets of the code from being validated.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>While standards compliant browsers will be spared the IE specific rules in conditional stylesheets, Internet Explorer users will incur code bloat, in the shape of duplicated selectors, as well as an extra HTTP request.  This extra request may also delay the loading of other resources on the page as IE7 and below will only download 2 resources in parallel (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282402">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282402</a>).</p>
<p>If these hacks are included in the main stylesheet, standards compliant browsers will take a small hit in terms of download size, but with a bit of care this should be negligible.  However, Internet Explorer users, the majority for most sites, will see a small benefit.</p>
<h3>Maintainability</h3>
<p>For the developer, IE specific stylesheets can cause issues when trying to trace the origin of CSS rules applied to a particular element. I tend to use Chrome&#8217;s developer tools to quickly trace the rule back to file and line number, but this method quickly leads to a wild goose chase when IE specific styles come into play. Including IE specific rules side by side with other rules makes it immediatly obvious where they are used and enables the use of any dev tool, such as Chrome or Firebug&#8217;s DOM inspector, to trace the origin of a particular rule.  I also use comments to make it even clearer what rule the hack is emulating as below:</p>
<p><code>#container {<br />
min-height:150px;<br />
/*min*/_height:150px;<br />
}</code></p>
<p>After dropping IE specific stylesheets in favour of the * and _ hacks for my last few projects, I see fewer and fewer compelling reasons to go back to the so called good practice of IE specific styles.  In fact, I find IE specific stylesheets encourage bad practice &#8211; when faced with a rather empty looking, I am tempted to add a quick hack to it rather than tackle the real problem!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hang on a moment, just double checking that title!  Internet Explorer 6?  Defence?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure most developers have been extremely keen to drop support for IE6 for years. I hate to think how many hours I&#8217;ve spent trying to work my way around it&#8217;s many foibles. But, in recent months, the debate about when we can finally drop support for the devil&#8217;s own browser has been raging on sites such as <a href="http://www.netmag.co.uk/">.net magazine&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.bringdownie6.com/">Bring Down IE6</a>.</p>
<p>One of the main accusations against IE6 is that it&#8217;s stranglehold on the browser market has been holding back the development of the web, but I&#8217;m not so sure it&#8217;s that straight forward. I don&#8217;t think anyone could deny that IE6&#8217;s ubiquity has made it more difficult to take advantage of many of the innovations, both in standards such as <a href="http://www.css3.info/">CSS3</a>, or from particular browser&#8217;s proprietary features, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_%28HTML_element%29">canvas</a>, which have been embraced by other vendors and standards bodies. But would it have been much better had IE6 disappeared years ago? Many of these features are still not supported by any version of IE to this day.</p>
<p>Microsoft has however supported a variety of it&#8217;s own proprietary features, many as far back as IE5.5, some of which have only just started to appear across other browsers. While the syntax is often rather long winded, Microsoft&#8217;s CSS filters have plugged many of the gaps in IE&#8217;s standards support, particularly with regard to opacity and <a href="http://www.3doughnuts.com/2009/06/css-3-rgba-colour-support/">RGBa background colours</a>.  IE5.5 also introduced <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms531186%28VS.85%29.aspx">word-wrap</a>, which probably should have been part of CSS from the start, but has only just been introduced by Mozilla in the <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox 3.5</a>!</p>
<p>In the past five years or so, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest">XMLHttpRequest</a> has, quite rightly, gained popularity for it&#8217;s ability to easily fetch data from the server while remaining on the same page. Whether we like to admit it or not, we have Microsoft to thank for that, the ActiveX object was developed for Outlook Web Access in Exchange and introduced in IE5 in 1999! Fully functional implementations of XMLHttpRequest only started to become available in other browsers in 2002.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 6 does have some serious rendering bugs and, compared to modern browsers, it is very slow in rendering and javascript execution. However, IE6 is about 8 years old and while other browsers have pushed forward the client side technologies available to developers since then, IE6 has, in many cases, had it&#8217;s own features which can be used, or hacked, to provide similar functionality. Maybe we should not be judging it by modern standards.</p>
<p>While nobody enjoys coding for IE6, without Microsoft&#8217;s innovations around Internet Explorer in the late 1990s, I think the situation would be much worse. If it wasn&#8217;t for features such as XMLHttpRequest, IE6&#8217;s domination would certainly have strangled innovation in client side development to a much greater extent. So maybe, rather than pouring scorn on IE6 at every opportunity, we should instead celebrate what, at the time, were innovative features and count ourselves lucky while we endure it&#8217;s slow demise.</p>
<p>&#8230;erm, I mean &#8211; BRING DOWN IE6!</p>
